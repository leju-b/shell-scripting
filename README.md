***Shell Scripting Learning Projects***
**Welcome to my Shell Scripting Learning Repository!**

This repository is a collection of shell scripts I've created while learning the fundamentals of shell scripting. The primary purpose is to document my learning journey, experiment with different scripting techniques, and share my progress with others.

_Project Structure:_

* Each script will be placed in its own directory.
* Directory names will typically reflect the script's purpose or functionality.
  
_Contributing:_
While this repository is primarily for my learning, feel free to fork and experiment with the scripts. If you find any issues or have improvements, please feel free to open a pull request.

_Disclaimer:_
The scripts in this repository are for learning purposes only. They might not be optimized or production-ready. Use them at your own risk.

Let's Learn Together!

Feel free to explore the different scripts and provide feedback.

***Happy Scripting!***
